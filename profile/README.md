## Hi! Welcome to UPES Open Community's Github Repo ðŸ‘‹

### About Us
OPEN is an initiative started with the aim of contributing to the Open Source community by providing a platform for training, guidance and awareness about various possibilities in the world of software to students and enthusiasts. We are motivated to provide a holistic environment to develop programs that can solve real-world problems while enhancing your communication, teamwork, leadership, ideation and other soft skills.

### Our Core Principles
#### Aware 
We aim at spreading awareness about the advantage of using Open Source softwares over conventional proprietary softwares.

#### Adopt
Spreading awareness is futile until and unless we motivate people to adopt the prevailing Open Source softwares in their work environment.

#### Contribute
The whole concept of Open Source revolves around community which uses it and contributing to the community is always a matter of prestige.
